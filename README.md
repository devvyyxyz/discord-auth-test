### Keep your fork up to date
You can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using GitHub's [Sync Fork button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork). You can also use the [pull](https://github.com/wei/pull) package created by [@wei](https://github.com/wei) to automate this process.

## ‚ô•Ô∏è Support the project 
I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project fork and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating and modifying stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

- Giving proper credit when you use **** to me on your readme, linking back to it :D
- Starring and sharing the project üöÄ
- you can make one-time donations via Patreon. I'll probably buy a coffee tea. üçµ
Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
